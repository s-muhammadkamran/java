JPA = Java Persistence API

How to start a Spring Boot Project with JPA, Hibernate, JDBC and H2 DB:
=======================================================================
Goto https://start.spring.io
Choose Maven as build tool, Java as language
Group name is the Package name
Artifact name is the ApplicationName
Packaging choose Jar
Choose Latest Java Version.
Add dependency for the following
1. Spring.Web
2. JPA
3. JDBC
4. H2

In the application.propertise file add the following config:
spring.h2.console.enabled=true

Run the application and then you can navigate the H2 console on the following URL:
http://localhost:8080/h2-console

Connect to H2 Database:
=======================
By default H2 DB will be started with you application
And the DB url will be generated dynamically, each time a new one when you start.
So we need to fix the URL of DB using application.propertise file config

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb

Then run your application and access H2 Console
http://localhost:8080/h2-console

You H2 DB will be empty, we need to have some tables in there.
In order to add the table we can have a resource file name schema.sql

Schema.sql:
===========
Create table course(
  id bigint not null,
  name varchar(255) not null,
  author varchar(255) not null,
  primary key (id)
);

The JPA framework when found this file at startup, it'll automatically create this table or run the specified SQL command.
